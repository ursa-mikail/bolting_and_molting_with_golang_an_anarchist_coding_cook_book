# Chapter 1: Hello, World! Now What?
## “Starting Strong: Hello, World! and Other Lies”
Every programming tutorial starts with the same smug ritual—“Hello, World!”
Print a string, close the tab, never build anything real.

Instead of “Hello, World!”, why not a BIST (Built-In Self Test) to run every aspects to ensure that it is well installed and ready to go?

Try using Go for a UI. Or a microcontroller. Or a kernel. Or a game.
Or basically anything off the narrow golden path of web servers and CLI tools.

You realize there’s no 
1. GoCard or GoEmbedded(embedded-friendly subset), GoSE, GoME, or GoEE, refer ... Java.
2. runtime-free mode.
3. plan beyond backend and tools.

---
**NOTE**

People should ensure
1. Proper BIST that ensure all aspects running. 
2. Stop inventing new syntax. If they are bored or want to `act cute or cool` don't drag people into their idiocractic campaign. 
3. Coverage for Embedded, all devices. Why should it differ other (by any other names other than called a 'rose') than it is connected to other devices or not?

It’s like they just made a language to be fanciful, but never finished the thought.

⚔️ Compare That to Java: The Broken Empire
Java, for all its crimes, at least tried to cover different domains:

---
**NOTE**

J2SE: Desktops
J2ME: Mobile
JavaCard: Embedded/smartcards
J2EE: Servers
JavaFX: Whatever that was supposed to be

Java got bloated, sure. But it had intent.
It answered the ancient question: “Can I write once, run anywhere—even in weird places?”
The answer was often painful, but possible.

Golang?
> “Just Docker it, bro.”

💣 The Core Problem
Every language promises simplicity, but reinvents another wheel - broken somewhere - until another crusade to do the same ITU (Inventing The Unnecessary). Imagine Dr Nobel Price inventing the talky stick ... 

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mflfp4VlEWo">Dr. Nobel Price's Talky Stick</a>

Then comes the bloat. Then the frameworks. Then the gatekeeping.

The real goal should be this:
> One language. One mindset. All domains.
> Not Hello, World in a box. But Hello, Everything assured to be running and relatable in learning reach.

**NOTE**

Why `pub`? Thinking of drinking? 
Why `fn`? Friday night? 

Use meaning and intuitive syntax, there are already ok'ed ones like `def` or just `function`.

If your language can’t run on my phone, my SIM card, and my web app without switching paradigms or personalities...

> Do I need a separate runtime just to wipe my ass?

🎯 What We’re Really Here to Do
This book isn’t about celebrating Go’s “clean” syntax or how fast it compiles.
It’s about asking:

> Why the hell is everyone inventing new syntax?
> Why can’t it do more, with less?
> Why does every language reinvent the same broken empire, just with addressing the more pressing issues?

We’re going to explore how to make Go easier to create.
And where it irritates, we’ll call it out.

Because the world doesn’t need another framework or `act cute or cool` syntax.
It needs to remap syntax to a real problem. If it does not exist, extend. If it is there, do not `act cute` and do `ITU`. 

A language should not be relearned, it should be minimal and ready to go. It should only extend if there is neo-lexeme required. 

---

**Example**
In German, there exists (∃) `Woher` (“From where?” (origin)) and `Wohin `( “To where?” (destination)), thence, `where-from` and `where-to`. These distinct spatial inquiries sharpen causal and temporal reasoning. 

---

A language should be compact, not bigger—until it fits in your hand, in your brain, and in your damn ass.
