# gRPC File Signing Service

A secure gRPC service that demonstrates TLS encryption and file signing with RSA signatures.

## 🎯 Features

- **TLS Encryption**: Secure gRPC communication with mutual TLS
- **File Signing**: Sign files using RSA-SHA256
- **Signature Verification**: Client-side verification of signatures
- **Simple Makefile**: Easy-to-use commands

🔐 Generating TLS certificates...
=== Cleaning up old certificates ===

=== Step 1: Generating CA certificate ===
✓ CA certificate created

=== Step 2: Generating server certificate with SANs ===
Certificate request self-signature ok
subject=C = US, ST = California, L = San Francisco, O = Test Server, CN = localhost
✓ Server certificate created

=== Step 3: Generating client certificate with SANs ===
Certificate request self-signature ok
subject=C = US, ST = California, L = San Francisco, O = Test Client, CN = client
✓ Client certificate created

=== Cleaning up temporary files ===

=== ✅ All certificates generated successfully! ===

This will:
1. Build server and client
2. Generate a test file
3. Start server in background
4. Sign the test file
5. Verify the signature
6. Clean up
