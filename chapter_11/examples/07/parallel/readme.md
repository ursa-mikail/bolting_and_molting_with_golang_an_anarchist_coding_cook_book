### Key Parallel Sync Features Demonstrated:
- WaitGroup Usage: sync.WaitGroup to wait for all goroutines
- Error Channel: Buffered channel to collect errors from goroutines
- Result Channel: Properly indexed results to maintain order
- Worker Pool Pattern: Controlled concurrent execution
- Error Handling: Comprehensive error collection and reporting
- Resource Management: Proper channel closing and cleanup

### Running the Parallel Demo:

```bash
cd client
go run demo_parallel.go
```

This demonstrates:
- Concurrent encryption of multiple strings
- Proper synchronization with sync.WaitGroup
- Error collection through channels
- Worker pool pattern for controlled parallelism
- Recovery verification in parallel context
