# Chapter 6: Packages and Modules — The Art of Delegation
## "Passing the Buck: Packages, Modules, and Blaming Others"

You’re not building everything yourself. No one does. You’re importing. Wrapping. Masking. You’re outsourcing responsibility under the guise of modularity.

Welcome to packages and modules: Where organization is illusion, and accountability is optional.

## 📦 Packages: Like Drawers with No Labels
Packages are supposed to group logic.
Instead:
- Some hold 1 function.
- Others, 300.
- Some are "utils", "helpers", or "common"—code graves with no ownership.
- You import them because you don’t understand them.
- You use them because you trust Stack Overflow.

And then when it breaks?
> “Oh, that’s from the thirdparty/foobar package, not our code.”

## 📚 Modules: Dependency or Dependency Hell?
Go Modules were meant to fix GOPATH chaos.
Instead, they:
- Break builds across versions
- Download the internet just to run a hello()
- Pin you to transitive deps maintained by a stranger with an anime avatar
- Fail silently or loudly depending on the phase of the moon

And every time a supply chain attack is discovered, the solution?
> “Let’s move fast and patch the module.”

Not rethink how we blindly trust anything pulled in.

## 🙈 Pretending You Wrote It
That compression library? That JWT parser? That entire frontend templating engine?

You didn’t write that. But when it works, you claim it. And when it fails? 

> “Oh, that’s from the module. It’s upstream. We just wrapped it.”

Delegation becomes deflection. Encapsulation becomes escapism.

## 🧱 Nested Packages: Package Inside Package Inside Package
Now your package has a package that has its own subpackage. Who are you vouching for again? Who signed off on what, and where? When the call stack explodes and the bugs dance through the layers, you're in a maze with no map. And some setups?

They use duplicated packages—same name, different location, slight variation. Good luck debugging that recursive hell on Groundhog Day.

## 🧠 You’re Not Reusing—You’re Absorbing Risk
Every imported function is unvetted surface area. Every update is a potential regression. Every convenience hides a contract you didn’t read. You pretend it’s modularity. What it really is: offloading risk and pretending you’re still in control.

## 🎯 The Point
- Packages and modules aren’t evil. But:
- Using them isn’t delegation. It’s inheritance.
- Importing blindly is not productivity. It’s gambling.
- Modularity without accountability? That’s just cowardice with better syntax.

In the end, your program is a stack of assumptions wrapped in imports signed by people you’ve never met. Stop pretending it’s your code. It’s a house of cards you shuffled from other people’s decks ... Nevermore ...
