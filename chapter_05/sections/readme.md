## Breakdown of Controls and Chaos
<pre>
Launch Control: Preflight Check
What Could Go Wrong: Preflight sensors could malfunction, causing an error.
Error Handling: If the error is detected, the mission is aborted to prevent catastrophic failure.

Orbit Adjustment: Error Retry
What Could Go Wrong: Thrusters could misalign during orbit adjustment, failing to correct trajectory.
Error Handling: Uses a loop to retry the adjustment up to three times. On repeated failure, the mission is terminated.

Docking Control: Managing Multiple Errors
What Could Go Wrong: Fuel leaks, navigation failures, or docking system malfunctions.
Error Handling: A switch statement is used to handle specific errors differently (e.g., abort docking, switch to manual controls).

Mission Logs: Embrace the Chaos
What Could Go Wrong: Critical errors like a hull breach or power failure could occur.
Error Handling: Simulates catastrophic errors with panic, but uses recover to handle them gracefully and prevent the program from crashing.

Key Takeaways:
Error Handling in Go: Use error for expected errors, panic for catastrophic errors, and recover to manage them gracefully.
Space Chaos Simulations: Randomness adds a realistic element of unpredictability.
Resilience: Even when things go very wrong, error handling ensures the program doesn’t completely crash.

Remember: In space, no one can hear you scream—but Go can handle your errors! 🚀✨
